### Step by Step to develop a RDBMS: FunDB

In few weeks ago, I started being interested in developing a custom Storage Engine of MySQL. I believe that's a good begining. However I found it much more difficult to finish a full featured Storage Engine without a good design and planning.

So I started thinking about what does a well designed RDBMS look like, and occasionarily I found there is a RDBMS course from [Carnegie Mellon University](https://db.cs.cmu.edu). Thanks CMU-DB group and internet that I can learn RDBMS from fundamental to advanced.

FunDB is just for fun, and it's an experiment Database for learning RDBMS knowledge purpose.
